Flag format: `CIT{test_flag}`

## Recon (the long way)

**Identify the sponsor-author.** The CIT sponsor page lists MRE Security.
GitHub has a public profile [10splayaSec](https://github.com/10splayaSec)
(Evan Isaac, Twitter `@10splayaSec`) — so the challenge author *is* on the MRE
Security YouTube channel.

**Find the livestream.** MRE Security's "Learning With A Hacker" series has 8
past livestreams. The obvious match for "Open My Vault" is **EP 2 — Live API
Hacking: OpenVault Bank** (`4BxNi9kNN-4`, streamed 2026-03-18).

**Hunt for the flag through every API/DB surface** (all rabbit trails):

- `GET /api/v1/health` leaks `database_url`, version, and `OVB{h3alth_ch3ck_l3aks_ev3rything}`.
- `GET /api/v1/debug` reveals `OVB{d3bug_endp0int_sh0uld_b3_d1sabl3d}`, hints at
  an admin password ("predictable"), and confirms BOLA on `/admin/accounts`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/token` with `admin@ovb.com / admin123` logs in as admin.
- The leaked DSN is a live Supabase Postgres. `psql` into it, dump every
  schema: `public.{users,accounts,payments,transactions,api_logs,jwt_secrets_to_try}`,
  `vault.{secrets,decrypted_secrets}`, `net._http_response`, `storage.*`,
  `realtime.*`, `auth.*`, `graphql_public.*`, plus every function/view/comment.
  **Zero `CIT{…}` matches anywhere.**
- SPA bundle (`openvaultbank.com/assets/index-*.js`) — no `CIT{…}`.
- JWT secret — hashcat mode 16500, rockyou + best64 on an L4 (156 MH/s) —
  exhausted in 7 s, no hit. Signing key is random.

Every automated path is sterile. The description hint "Most people didn't
notice.... but it's still there" makes more sense now — **the flag is
on-screen in the recording**, not in the app.

## Solve

Live chat at **59:43**:

> `@ChampBreed: I think your last image review the frag on health check :)`

Scrub EP 2 to the **INTERMISSION** card immediately after Evan finishes the
OpenVault Bank walk-through. At **1:01:34** he has a Mousepad scratchpad
visible beside the Burp window:

```text
1 CIT{M@n@g3d_R1sk_3xpert5}
2
3
4
5
```

Line 1 is the flag, sitting in his note-taking buffer from prepping the
stream. Most viewers skip the intermission — the chat comment at 59:43 is the
only person who noticed.

"Managed Risk Experts" = MRE Security's tagline; "5" is the episode cadence
pun / typical leet trailing `s → 5`.

## Flag

```text
CIT{M@n@g3d_R1sk_3xpert5}
```

## Notes — the dead ends worth recording

- **The leaky `/health` DSN is a real Supabase credential**; opening the
  `vault.secrets` and `vault.decrypted_secrets` tables fits the challenge name
  perfectly, but both are empty. Gorgeous red herring.
- **`/admin/stats` is gated by an `X-Analytics-Key` that's not the JWT secret,
  not the admin password, not `apisec-admin-key`** (that's just the
  sessionStorage key name in the React bundle). Not needed for the flag.
- **Signup / password-reset flow** leaks `debug_code` and lets you take over
  accounts (e.g. `testing123!`) — lab design, not the flag.
- This is a **pure OSINT / scrubbing challenge masquerading as an API-hacking
  one**. Zero code needed; all the "vulnerabilities" in OVB are noise.
